# Yo! 👋

I'm an aspiring **Systems Programmer** who loves tinkering with everything from mid-level to high-level languages.

## 🎯 Currently Grinding
- Learning how to write assembly (I can only read it lol)
- Creating a game
- Writing poems (Does that even count as tech?)
- Practicing reverse engineering

## 🏆 I've competed in many events:
- 🚀 1 Hackathon (24hrs non-stop app building)  
- 🎯 2 Pitching Competitions 
- 💻 1 Programming Competition
- 🛡️ 2 Capture The Flag (CTF) Events

But if my programming skills aren't too impressive, I can give you a poem if you want 😏.
